## Project Overview

Given an image of a dog, this algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. This is accomplished using [Transer Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) and [CNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network).



### Prerequisites

Setup a Jupyter notebook with Pytorch + GPU
- I suggest setting up a [local GPU enabled workspace](https://medium.com/@ab9.bhatia/set-up-gpu-accelerated-tensorflow-keras-on-windows-10-with-anaconda-e71bfa9506d1)

### If Notebook not loading in github
Use this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SpicySyntax/DogBreedClassifier/blob/master/dog_app.ipynb)

#### Note: This will not work without the training data I have on disk
